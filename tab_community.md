Previous workshop Notes:

During the AppSec conferences, the SAMM project team organises workshops
for you to influence the direction SAMM evolves.

This is also an excellent opportunity to exchange experiences with your
peers.

If you plan on attending <http://appsec.eu> be sure to get involved in
the SAMM workshop (scheduled on Jun-23).
