## Call for SAMM2 Sponsors

OWASP SAMM and the upcoming SAMM 2.0 release is the open source software
security maturity model used to develop secure software for IT,
application and software security technologists.

We are seeking sponsors to support OWASP SAMM. All proceeds from the
sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation and the further
development of SAMM. Supporting the project drives the funding for
research grants, SAMM hosting, tools, templates, documents, promotion,
and more.

By sponsoring SAMM, you not only support an important and flagship OWASP
project, you will also get visibility during the next SAMM Summit (part
of the [Open Security Summit 2019](https://open-security-summit.org/))
and recognition on the OWASP SAMM [web site](https://owaspsamm.org/) and
the next release of SAMM (version 2.0).
